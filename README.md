# Midnight-Alley
An interactive 3D car garage experience built with Three.js, featuring cinematic animations and inspection-focused camera controls.
The project showcases a dramatic car drop-in intro animation, detailed part inspections (tires, bonnet, trunk), and contextual hologram-style UI overlays that display component information when focused.
Users can smoothly switch between predefined viewpoints using UI buttons, explore the car with OrbitControls, and receive real-time visual feedback when inspecting specific parts — all rendered in an open environment without walls or roof for maximum clarity.
